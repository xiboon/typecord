# Typecord
A HTTP Interaction library for bots using the Discord API.

## Installation
```bash
npm install typecord
```
Keep in mind, typecord only handles the HTTP interaction part of the bot. You may want to use other libraries like:
- [@fuwa/rest](https://npmjs.com/package/@fuwa/rest) or [@discordjs/core](https://npmjs.com/package/@discordjs/core) for making requests to the Discord API
- [@discordjs/builders](https://npmjs.com/package/@discordjs/builders) for building different things like embeds, message components etc.
## TODO
- add usage examples to todo
- documentation
- attachment support
- other interaction types
- add all imports to index.ts
- create-typecord-app cli
